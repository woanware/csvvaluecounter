csvvaluecounter
===============

## Info ##

Sometimes it is hard looking for values when there are large amounts of data e.g. hundreds of different mutex names, named pipes, file names etc. csvvaluecounter is a very simple tool that takes a CSV, gets the field value from the CSV as specified from the file, keeps count of each unique value, sorts by number, and then value, and outputs a file, not rocket science and could be easily solved using the bash command line.
